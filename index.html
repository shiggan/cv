                  <li>Large old codebases always have their own set of challenges; part of the highlights is 'imparting
                    the secret knowledge of how old sysems are written' to the more junior team members and watching
                    them 'get it' (mainly because I am old enough to have written
                    code like that).</li>
                  <li>Origonally the project used an old version of TFS (Team Foundation Server); had no branching
                    methodology; and a large product backlog. Once we got branching under control we moved to managing
                    the
                    backlog in Azure Dev-Ops and eventually migrated form on prem tfs to GIT on azdo (incluidng all 14

                  <li>As a Senior developer and lead support agent on a number of systems; I maintain familiarity across
                    many systems for a number of clients, paying particular attention to the ones I own on a daily
                    basiss.</li>
                  <li>As an incident manager; sitting in between technical resolve team and the client on high
                    criticality incidents. My main job is to act as a conduit for comms between the technical resolve
                    team and the client; where necessary unblock the technical-resolve team.</li>
                  <li>As an incident resolver; work on the pointy end to resolve a production incident with a client;
                    usually by acting in the technical-resolve team you are a subject matter expert on the affected
                    system or less common the impacted technologies if the sme's are running into resolution issues.
                  </li>
                  <li>For the systems I own on a daily basis I do the day-to-day incident resolution and development;
                    again the work can vairy wildly form one system to another; but generally i do a lot of estimating,
                    estimate-review, code review, and very importantly for my role knowledge sharing.</li>
