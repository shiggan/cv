                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Client engagements are wide ranging and varrying; not all pratices are relevent for all clients or systems. As functioning in a service delivery organisation 
              I have a lot of experience in applying just the right amount of agility in order to respond to situations as they arise.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p>A core aspect of my aproach to implementing DevOps pratices in a new client or system 
              Determining where they are at; the fundamental concepts that should be applied as a mimimum; once the fundamentals are established 
              and as a part of a continious improvement process move the client and system to a place that is approprate for the
              client and their particular needs. </p>
            <p>I have successfully implemented a number of dev-ops pratices with a wide range of customer systems including.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Automated database and website changes into release enironments<br>
              Automated delivery particulraly to databases implies a number of other dependent processes, starting at branching and/or feature 
              flagging through proving a set of changes is fit for purpose. Using Azure-Devops I have developed build, test, and release pipelines 
              to deliver changes into systems. </br> 
              I enjoy demoing this process with clients new to the technology and ideas, there was a time when a client was visibly excited when I 
              showed them the automation around approval workflows, particularaly when also using the product backlog integration.  
              </li>
              <li>Setting up continious testing with reporting</br>
              Where needed and approprate seperating unit and integration testing (e.g. integration testing on a deployed environment); also where 
              needed setup code coveage reporting.
              </li>
              <li>Establishing branching strategy</br> 
              Sometimes in the role of maintaining systems you get your hands on a sysem where either there is no strategy in use; and the solution 
              is not setup for continious delivery and you are running into surprises in production, or the strategy that is being used is not working
              for any number of reasons.</br>
              Back in the TFS days I worked on a system that employed a 'trunk development' and 'release environment' models in short you developed large features
              on trunk and branched the solution for each isolated-environment you went into (user-acceptance and production) and ported fixes back and forth. 
              The features were large and complex; acceptance testing was slow and tough; with a bit of code churn and branch maintanence stress. We ended up moving to a 'release branch' and
              'feature branch' model. We worked on features on seperate branches (we could have used feature-flagging); when complete merge them into trunk, and 
              branch a release which went through user-acceptance and production environents. While we still had the odd issue with branches conflicting we did 
              however we managed to resolve a lot of the other issues we had.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Baking in the tooling and measuring systems in is only part of the journey; there is also reporting on your non functional requirements; Establishing
              knowledge around how the systems behave so you can work on alerting for when systmes start misbehaving.

                to a trusted advisor which enables you recommend development, and process changes in conjunction with a clientâ€™s business needs. 
                Coordinating work for my team; from requirements gathering, specification, estimation to delivery. Applying aspects of Dev-ops ideas; and Agile

                Guiding team members towards developing the skills to formalize, specify, estimate, and deliver against
                a business requirement. Sometimes this involves guidance from a business process, system architectural
                or lower level implementation detail. I believe in establishing a zero-blame culture, I by default take the
                postiion that there are no 'daft questions' and everything is a learning opportunity irregardless of experience,
                familarity or tenure in an organisation or system. I recieve consistent positivle feedback form my line managers
                about how I work with my more junior co-workers and help gorw them into well rounded professionals.

                15 or so years is a lot of time to summarise; nontherless I have a lot of experience working independently, in teams,
                managing my own backlogs, managing my teams, and working against backlogs managed by other people. I spend a lot of 
                my own time reading about ideas, code and systems as well as working on my own projects (see my github links above) which 
                helps solidify ideas.

                  <p>In the place of nothing Azure DevOps (azdo) allows for a simple yet

                    our existing wiki tooling that is at the end of its life.</p>
                  <p>Over the past year or so working with management, delivery, and support teams I have put together a
                    set of templates which provide a skeleton for project and support teams to start from, as we are
                    formalising on Azure DevOps Wiki pages for project documentation the templates are designed to be
                    imported into a azdo Wiki site where the team can start filing them out from there using the
                    templates as a guideline for the sort of information that is needed and encouraging them to write

                <div class="role">Senior developer</div>
                <div>The work I end up doing can vairy a bit wildly but can be summed up as.</div>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a Senior developer I am a lead support agent on a number of systems for a number of clients,
                    paying particular attention to the ones I own on a daily
                    basiss.</li>
                  <li>As an incident manager; sitting in between technical resolve team and the client on high
                    criticality incidents. My main job is to act as a conduit for comms between the technical resolve
                    team and the client; where necessary unblock the technical-resolve team.</li>
                  <li>As an incident resolver; work on the pointy end to resolve a production incident with a client;
                    usually by acting in the technical-resolve team you are a subject matter expert on the affected
                    system or less common the impacted technologies if the sme's are running into resolution issues.
                  </li>
                  <li>For the systems I own on a daily basis I do the day-to-day incident resolution and development;
                    again the work can vairy wildly form one system to another; but generally I do a lot of estimating,
                    estimate-review, code review, knowledge sharing, and software development.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li></li>
                  <li>Being one of the old hands in the organisation at one point in time or another I have had my hand
                    in a lot of systems; had my fair share of critical incident resolution and management. Highlights
                    would have to include the feeling you get when you are deep into resolving a critical incident; and
                    finally get to a resolution. </li>
