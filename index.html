                  <p>In the place of nothing Azure DevOps (azdo) allows for a simple yet
                    powerfull way to achieve a level of automation around testing and delivering of code changes into
                    produciton environments. </p>
                  <p>Over the past few years I have pushed the support side of the business to use more of the testing
                    and releasing functionality provided in azdo; in doing so I have been able to migrate a number of
                    projects to use azdo for continious-testing and releasing.</p>

                  <p>An opportunity has been apparent for some time for somebody to pick up around project
                    documentation; so I decided to champion that and develop a set of documentation templates to replace
                    our existing wiki tooling that is at the end of its life.</p>
                  <p>Over the past year or so working with management, delivery, and support teams I have put together a
                    set of templates which provide a skeleton for project and support teams to start from, as we are
                    formalising on Azure DevOps Wiki pages for project documentation the templates are designed to be
                    imported into a azdo Wiki site where the team can start filing them out from there using the
                    templates as a guideline for the sort of information that is needed and encouraging them to write
                    more about their solution.</p>

                  common elsewhere in the software-development world; we circulated these pratices in our team for a
                  number of months responding to the odd adjustment; eventually bringing them to the wider organisation
                  as a set
